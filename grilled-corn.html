    <p>Corn is always a tasty addition to a dinner, but there are better and worse ways to prepare it.</p>
    <p>Here at Cooking for Coders, we believe that grilling corn <em><u>before you shuck it</u></em> is the tastiest way to cook it!</p>
    <p>Grilling corn while it's still wrapped in it's little corn-shell is a great way to add smoky flavor, but wrapping it in foil is also a great option.</p>
